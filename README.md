This project was developed as part of a talk on [code-agnostic packages at Paris ForumPHP 2016](https://thecodingmachine.github.io/forumphp2016talk/).

It contains a wrapper around OpenWeatherMap API.

Important: this is just a demo, not a real complete OpenWeatherMap API. If you are looking for a full blown API to get the weather, there are plenty of packages that do that perfectly on Packagist. Just find one that suit your needs.
